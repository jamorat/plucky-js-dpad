JavaScript dpad for info navigation / game control

Originally was a project built for desktop web browsing where the user could place their mouse near the edge of the screen in order to 'fly a spaceship around.' (Accomplished by using JQuery to move a DIV.)

However, in the transition to mobile - there is no mousepointer to place at the edge of the screen, hence a dpad approach. 
I originally put this code together as a proof of concept for someone who was considering the possibility of bringing their vintage goods store online. Ended up taking a different approach, but this really cool code remains.

Uses:
 - JQuery
 - various mobile optimizations (such as touch and viewport) for iOS
